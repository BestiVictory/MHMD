# MHMD
The colorization of historical personâ€™s clothing is of practical significance, especially the colorization of historical military uniform.  At present, most of the existing modern color image datasets contain modern objects or scenes but lack the old content or information of real gray historical images, especially the colors of the garments of the historical persons. Therefore, we build a dataset called MHMD: Modern Historical Movies Dataset. MHMD can meet the requirements of garment types, eras and nationalities at the same time. We search for 147 historical movies and TV series in modern time. After preprocessing, the MHMD dataset obtains 1,353,166 images. We classify the images into 42 labels according to the garment types, eras and nationalities.
